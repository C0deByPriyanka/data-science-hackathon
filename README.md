# Ecommerce Product Categorization Hackathon

## Overview

This project is part of the KnowledgeHut AI Hackathon for Ecommerce Product Categorization. The goal is to build a multi-class text classifier that categorizes products based on their descriptions and other relevant features.

## Steps

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Loaded datasets, handled missing values, and performed necessary data transformations.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data distributions and identified patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Combined text features and converted categorical features to numerical.
4. **Model Building**: Built and tuned a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF for text features.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using F1-score and cross-validation.
6. **Predictions**: Predicted product categories on the test set and prepared submission.
